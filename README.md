## Image Proccessing ##
The project aims to perform image analysis using morphological operators in order to identify and analyze different patterns and textures in images.
 The project involves the application of morphological operations, such as erosion, dilation, opening and closing, to extract features from images.
These features will be used to categorize and categorize textures in images. The project also includes introducing variations into the images, such as background changes, noise, rotation, lighting, and disturbances, to assess the system's ability to handle real-world variations.
